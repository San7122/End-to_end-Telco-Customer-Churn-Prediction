# Telco Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis Project

![Cover Image](cover%20image.png)

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning techniques. The objective is to identify customers who are likely to leave the company and provide business insights for retention.

---

## Problem Statement

Customer churn causes a significant loss to businesses. Early prediction of churn customers helps in taking preventive actions and improving customer satisfaction.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Churn Distribution
Shows how many customers churned vs stayed.

---

### Churn by Contract Type
Month-to-Month customers churn the most.

---

### Monthly Charges vs Churn (Boxplot)
Higher charges â†’ Higher churn probability.

## Final Results

| Model                | Accuracy After CV & Tuning |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Logistic Regression | 79.63 %                   |
| Decision Tree       | 79.24 %                   |
| Random Forest       | 81.45 %                   |
| SVM                 | 82.31 %                   |
| KNN                 | 79.02 %                   |

## Business Insights & Recommendations

- Focus on retaining new customers (low tenure).  
- Convert Month-to-Month customers to long-term contracts.  
- Improve service for Fiber Optic Internet users.  
- Offer better deals to customers using Electronic Check.
